Welcome! I am a doctoral candidate in the [SDSU/UC San Diego Joint Doctoral Program in Clinical Psychology](https://psychology.sdsu.edu/doctoral/clinical/). My research focuses on addressing health disparities experienced by individuals from multiply marginalized communities. I center my work on racial/ethnic and sexual and gender minority populations at the intersection of HIV, substance use, and public health. A central focus of my research is understanding stigma—particularly intersectional stigma—and how it shapes health outcomes, engagement in care, and resilience. I explore topics including harm reduction, substance use treatment, PrEP adherence, HIV-related outcomes, discrimination, and structural oppression.

My dissertation examines resilience among people living with HIV who use methamphetamine, with the goal of informing more effective and affirming interventions for individuals navigating overlapping stigmas and health challenges.

In addition to my research, I have clinical training in the treatment of substance use disorders, trauma, and relationship and sexual concerns. My experience includes individual therapy as well as couples and sex therapy, grounded in trauma-informed and culturally responsive care.

I am also the co-director of the Harm Reduction International Health Collective, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that provides harm reduction services, health education, and community care to San Diego’s unhoused population. This work fuels my passion for community-driven approaches to public health and reinforces the importance of bridging research, cslinical practice, and grassroots action.

Driven by a deep commitment to health equity, I strive to advance evidence-based, community-informed interventions. My work builds bridges across disciplines and sectors—collaborating with researchers, clinicians, and community partners—to improve the care, health, and wellbeing of historically and systematically excluded communities.
